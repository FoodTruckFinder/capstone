## Whats Currently in Development
Functionality
Form Validation for Sign-in/Sign-up for users 
Build out sign up for vendors
PostCurrent Location function so vendors can post their location to the Database
Search Bar + Filter functionality by foodtruck name

Front End:
change font types & sizes to work better as a responsive website
keep colors/theme consistent on every page (stick to color scheme)
make it so foodtruck cards are all the same size (image likely has have to be resized to be uniform), long input here will mess with our formatting
add a see more button on the foodtruck cards so that the full description is hidden
Brand the about me page so that it matches with the rest of our site.

Bugs:
Make it so sign-in and sign-up work on the Foodtruck Profiles page

Future Features:
Facebook/Twitter/Instagram integration 
3 good deeds (?)
