			<p>Food Truck Finder is a web app designed to help food truck users easily find the best food nearby as well as a resource for food truck owners to let their fans know when they are open for business, what items are on the menu, and more. Albuquerque has great food, and we've created an app that helps both locals and tourists find the best food as quickly as possible.</p>
